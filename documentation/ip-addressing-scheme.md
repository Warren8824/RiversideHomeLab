## 📁 `documentation/ip-addressing-scheme.md`

### 🧾 Purpose  
This document details the internal IP addressing scheme used across the virtual lab network. Each site (Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool, Hull) is logically segmented into its own subnet to simulate real-world office branch networking. The goal is to mirror common enterprise setups for Active Directory, DHCP, and inter-site routing practices.

### 🌐 Subnet Overview

| Site         | Network        | Subnet Mask   | IP Range              | Purpose        |
|--------------|----------------|---------------|------------------------|----------------|
| Manchester   | 10.90.10.0     | 255.255.255.0 | 10.90.10.1 – .254      | Head Office    |
| Leeds        | 10.90.20.0     | 255.255.255.0 | 10.90.20.1 – .254      | Branch Office  |
| Liverpool    | 10.90.30.0     | 255.255.255.0 | 10.90.30.1 – .254      | Branch Office  |
| Hull         | 10.90.40.0     | 255.255.255.0 | 10.90.40.1 – .254      | Branch Office  |
| NAT Network  | 192.168.100.0  | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.100.1 – .254   | Internet NAT   |

### 🧠 Addressing Conventions

- **.1** reserved for DC01’s interface on that subnet (acting as default gateway + DHCP relay)
- **.2 – .19** reserved for infrastructure (future additions like file servers, printers, etc.)
- **.20 – .250** reserved for dynamic DHCP lease pool
- **.251 – .254** reserved for static/manual assignments if needed (e.g., firewall, test servers)

---

### 🌍 Routing Design

- All subnets are routed via DC01
- RRAS service enabled on DC01 for inter-site routing and internet NAT
- NAT is handled via internal adapter connected to `192.168.100.0/24` (NATSwitch)

> _Could include a screenshot from RRAS showing the active NAT config or routing interfaces._

### 📡 DHCP Configuration (via DC01)

| Subnet       | Scope Range             | Default Gateway | DNS Server     | Domain Name       |
|--------------|--------------------------|------------------|----------------|--------------------|
| Manchester   | 10.90.10.20 – .250       | 10.90.10.1       | 10.90.10.1     | riverside.local    |
| Leeds        | 10.90.20.20 – .250       | 10.90.20.1       | 10.90.10.1     | riverside.local    |
| Liverpool    | 10.90.30.20 – .250       | 10.90.30.1       | 10.90.10.1     | riverside.local    |
| Hull         | 10.90.40.20 – .250       | 10.90.40.1       | 10.90.10.1     | riverside.local    |

> _Adding screenshots from the DHCP console would be 🔥 for this one — even if just Manchester's scope properties._

### 🛠️ Lessons Learned

- Simulating multi-site routing on a single host was harder than expected but rewarding
- Needed to manually configure static IPs on server NICs to match role and subnet layout
- DHCP relay wasn't needed since DC01 has an interface in each subnet

### ✅ Optional :

- Screenshot of `ipconfig /all` from a client showing DHCP config working
- Screenshot of DHCP leases on DC01
- Diagram of subnets with IP ranges marked out (visually)
